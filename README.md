Some interesting things I've worked on more recently:
- **[BOS Web Engine](https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine)** - sandboxed Web3 Components ([Babel plugin](https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine/blob/main/packages/compiler/src/transpile.ts))
- **[Chain Hosted UI](https://github.com/near/chain-hosted-ui)** - prototype for blockchain-hosted assets managed by smart contract ([deploy script](https://github.com/near/chain-hosted-ui/blob/main/packages/presets/src/scripts/deploy-app.ts))
- **[Near API JS](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)** - decoupled single library into monorepo packages, updated to support ESM w/tree shaking
